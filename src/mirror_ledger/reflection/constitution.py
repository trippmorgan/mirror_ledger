# mirror_ledger/reflection/constitution.py

"""
This file codifies the "Block Zero Theology" of the Mirror Ledger system.
It serves as the immutable moral and ethical constitution that governs the AI's
self-reflection process. This is not merely a set of rules, but a declaration of
the system's foundational values, rooted in a Christian worldview.

It is designed to be read by the `reflection/evaluator.py` module, which acts as
the guardian of these principles.
