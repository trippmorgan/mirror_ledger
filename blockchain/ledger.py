"""
This module implements the `BlockchainLedger`, the high-level manager for the chain.
It acts as the primary interface for all other system components that need to read from or
write to the ledger. Its methods are designed as "smart contracts"â€”controlled functions that
ensure the chain's rules of integrity and evolution are respected.

This class encapsulates the list of blocks and is responsible for foundational tasks such as
creating the first block (the "Genesis Block") and adding subsequent blocks correctly.
